It keeps track of rider even when his size is changing (he needs to bounce on horse to keep balance). Even when horse jumps, rider frame is tracking. However this tracker does not handle occlusion - you can see it on 02:44, but overall result is impressive.       |\n",

It started really well, it also does better job of adjusting frame size to tracked object size, but on 01:02 it completely lost tracked object and started to track incorrect object. (I think this is because of similarity of background colors and rider's suit).
